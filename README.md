# Spring Kotlin Marriage
## A simple app
This is my attempt to explore Spring echosystem and try Kotlin in it. 
Bu I have found out that it is actually done in Kotlin v1.0.6 with the help of Kotlin-Spring extension plugin.

This plugin makes all Spring annotated Kotlin classes open and that makes them inheritable by other proxy classes on the fly used by Spring.
